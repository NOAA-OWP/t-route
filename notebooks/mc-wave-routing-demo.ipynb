    "The Muskingum-Cunge (MC) model is a kinematic wave approximation of the St. Venant equations with parameters based on channel characteristics. The model is coded in Fortran and frequently called by Python scripts in the t-route repository. This notebook demonstrates the application of the MC model. The notebook reviews how to create an extension module that allows Fortran functions to be called by Python, how to set up the model domain, specify river segment parameters, execute the model, and evaluate output. Model application is reviewed in the context of two simple experiments.\n",

We do this by adding new directories to the path. We have some logic to accomodate execution in Google Colaboratory notebooks, as needed."

The downstream response is illustrated with a blue line. Wave propagation significantly alters the shape of the downstream hydrograph. Specifically, there is a more gradual increase from the initial condition (0.21 cms) to the peak flow, which is much lower than 1 cms.
