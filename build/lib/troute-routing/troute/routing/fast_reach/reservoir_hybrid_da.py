            OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS:
            ----------------------
            - should we presist the previously persisted outflow if an 
              observation was found but was outside of the obs_lookback_hours
            
            - What to do with the persistence weight? Persistence weights are 
              intended to control what fraction of the outflow value is from
              the levelpool simulation, versus the assimilated observation.
              However, these values are all ones in the reservoir parameter. Is
              this still of utility. It is not considered in this code, yet. 
            
            - If no good observation is found, then we do not update the 
              update time. Consequently we will continue to search for a good
              observation at each model timestep, before updating the update
              time.
