# To compile the fortran modules, 
# First activate a python version with the f2py extension for python 3+
# Then, execute the following command:
<<<<<<< HEAD
f2py3 -c varSingleChStime_f2py.f90  MCsingleChStime_f2py_clean.f90  -m mc_sc_stime
=======
f2py3 -c varSingleRchStime_f2py.f90  MCsingleRchStime_f2py_clean.f90  -m mc_sc_stime
>>>>>>> upstream/master
# Finally, if the link does not exist, create it by the following command, 
# substituting <cpythonversioname> for the version name your f2py compiler is 
# appending to the library name:
ln -s mc_sc_stime.<cpythonversionname>.so mc_sc_stime.so

# Once compiled, the library should be accessible to the library functions in 
# the python notebooks demonstrating the parallel Muskingum Cunge execution.
